# Work-Day-Scheduler
For this particular challenge, we were tasked with creating a work day scheduler using third-party API (moment.js) to dynamically show the current date/time on the page and to utilize the current hour to display color coded time blocks (past, present, future).  Using the provided starter code (html and CSS) I organized and named the various timeblock sections in HTML to align with the styling/color codes that were preassigned.  A variety of jquery/javscript methods were utilized to save user input to local storage and to retrieve the values so that they remain on the screen upon refresh.

Screenshots below show the scheduler with color coded sections for past (grey), present (red), and future (green).  Appointments remain on the page upon refresh.
